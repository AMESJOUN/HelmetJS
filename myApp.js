/**Your page could be put in a <frame> or <iframe> without your consent. This can result in clickjacking attacks, among other things. Clickjacking is a technique of tricking a user into interacting with a page different from what the user thinks it is. This can be obtained by executing your page in a malicious context, by means of iframing. In that context, a hacker can put a hidden layer over your page. Hidden buttons can be used to run bad scripts. This middleware sets the X-Frame-Options header. It restricts who can put your site in a frame. It has three modes: DENY, SAMEORIGIN, and ALLOW-FROM.

We donâ€™t need our app to be framed.

Use helmet.frameguard() passing with the configuration object {action: 'deny'} */
